#+TITLE: Exercise 1A
#+AUTHOR: Martin Homuth

Write a program to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a
sample of n real numbers. The mean is the average of the numbers. The
formula for standard deviation is
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \rho (x_1,...,x_n) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-x_{avg})^2}{n - 1}}
#+END_SRC
where \rho(x_1,...,x_n) is the standard deviation of the x values and
x_{avg} is the average of these n values. The standard deviation
calculation is described in Section A2.

Use a linked list to hold the n numbers.

Program 1A Testing: Thoroughly test the program. At least three of the
tests should use the data in each of the three columns on the right of
Table D5. The standard deviations for the columns in this table are
Object LOC: 572.03; New and Changed LOC: 625.63; and Development
Hours: 62.26. The standard deviation for the New and Changed LOC case
is worked out in Section A2.1

  Modules:
       - linked list
	 - uses floats
       - linked list tester
	 - simple unit tests
	 - boundaries
	 - ordering
       - standard deviation
	 - see page 509 for steps (pretty accurate and clear)
       - standard deviation tester
	 - obvious and simple examples
	 - invalid data
       - main application
	 - simple combination of modules
       - application tests using table
	 - more tests than the suggested three columns are not
           necessary, right?
